# Due

A framework built for Deno, using Vue.js 3

As of now this project is more of a template rather than a library showcasing how to use Vue.js with Deno.
That is until a module library and command line interface is created.

You can test and see a copy using the Gitpod below.

## Running

```bash
deno run --allow-run --allow-read mod.ts
```

This should create a server on <http://localhost:8000> using Vue.js as the core framework.
