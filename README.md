# Due

A framework built for Deno, using Vue.js
As of know this project is a template rather than a library.
That is until a module library and command line interface is created.

## Running

```sh
deno run --allow-{run,read} mod.ts
```

This should create a server on <http://localhost:8000> using Vue.js as the core framework.
